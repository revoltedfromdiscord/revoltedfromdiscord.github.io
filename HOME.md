## What?

Recently, Discord has been on their quest to implement age restriction, 
as per legally obligated by the U.K. government with their Online Safety
Act.

This has largely impacted people all over the U.K., yet nothing was done
to stop it. This was a big mistake. When you do not stop the people at the
top of the world from doing what they want, they keep on doing what they want.

Since then, Discord has been slowly rolling out forced age verification
in countries requiring it like Australia, and then declared they were on their 
way to enforce it in countries that do not require it as well.

And now, they decided that they would enforce that policy for everyone.
This is the same company that had a leak of 70k user's IDs from people verifying
in the U.K. and Australia by the way.

## Why?

There are a lot of reasons why this happens. They say it's for safety,
but people say it's to make companies providing the age verification AI technologies
more money (*"if you don't have the demand, create the demand"*) and others say
it's ofcourse to collect data to train AI or tracking for companies and governments.

But, really, who cares? Here's the objective facts, the unalienable truth:
They are removing our freedom of speech unless we link our sayings to a legal ID that 
companies and governments can track down. This is a direct infraction to Article 19 
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

But no one is coming here to save us. If we don't do anything, we'll lose all our rights
one by one, and without freedom of expression, we can't defend our other rights.
This is how totalitarian states like the USSR and the German Reich were created, by the way.

## Who?

It is impossible to say whose fault it is. Probably it is the fault of multiple people,
but we'll never be able to pinpoint who exactly. However, we still have to fight it somehow.

We believe that Discord is part of the problem by rolling out age verification worldwide
on a platform that is made specifically to talk. This results in people losing communities
and friends online. Will this reduce the amount of online victims from bullying or sexual
harrasment? Maybe. But this cannot be right if you're reducing the amount of potential
victims and not the actual amount of dirty people.

If you are willing to, you can also fight more by switching other platforms too. YouTube, 
Roblox, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit and even Spotify (yes, the app for music) are rolling this
out too. They were already nasty in their ways to collect your data and track you. Now they're
even nastier because they reduce our fundamental and unalienable rights of free speech.

## But doesn't this only affect children?

Ofcourse not! It's not because the system only rejects children that it only impacts them.
Welcome to the real world. To prove you're not a child you will be forced to upload your legal
ID to every platform you visit, and even then the platforms will use AI and heavy tracking they've
had forever to automatically choose whether you're able to see this content, and in the case
of a false positive - which happens way more often than you'd think - you'd have to upload your
ID once again. What a great world we are living in.

## But atleast this protects the children, right?

Ahh, how naive of a person are you. In reality, it doesn't change a damn thing.
And even when it does, it is such a slight change that is not worth the price of our freedom.

If you keep the creeps, they will find a way to find the children.
And children aren't stupid! They will find a way to continue what they were doing.
They will find a new app without age restriction, or bypass verifications with fake documents
or fake pictures of realistic game skins.

The only way to protect the children is to remove the danger, not remove the people endangered.

## But really, why would I want to fight?

Here's a quick list of reasons:

- You shouldn't have to pull out your ID to be able to express yourself online.
- You shouldn't have to have everything you do tracked to prove you are really an adult.
- You shouldn't have to fear a company leaking your ID unlike how it happened
- Others will still find a way to bypass the checks with fake IDs or other hacks
- This will create a market of verified accounts that creeps can buy to talk to minors more easily
- The internet was never meant to be centralized, yet alone reversed to people verifying their age
- People will no longer be able to use tinier websites that don't have enough money to implement age verification
- A real solution shouldn't remove the people endangered but remove the actual danger
- This is against the Article 19 of the UDHR, against Article 10 of the ECHR, and more
- This makes misuse easier and allows for the people at the top of society to get more power
- This may lead to the development of more totalitarist nations in the near future
- Without the right of free speech, we cannot defend our other rights

## But aren't there policitians to represent us?

For the majority, it's in their best interest to represent themselves instead of us.
And in democracies, the majority always wins. That's literaly how it was created.
It doesn't mean a majority of people want this. It just means a majority of politicians
want it. And in other political regimes, the result is the same. 
The people at the top win. And the people at the top are not in our interest either.

In other words, save yourself. No one will do anything for you.

Here's a little list of alternatives you may find for Discord:

- Stoat (known before as Revolt): a direct alternative to Discord.
  Same features, same UI, completely free, no subscriptions at all.
  The only thing missing are the communities that exist of Discord only.
  That is why we need to inform people and convince them to switch too.
  The more people join, the even more people will join.
  Also, it has existed for years already, so it's stable and there
  are already tiny communities here.
  Please note however that it doesn't feature any encryption (yet).

- Spacebar: also a direct alternative to Discord. But they have 
  been through a lot of "unstability" recently, with the deprecation of 
  their official client in favor for a blank webpage proposing you to
  wait for the new client or use a third party client like Fermi.
  However they do have almost all the features Discord have for free,
  except the mobile app.
 
- Strafe: also a direct alternative to Discord, but feels way buggier
  although it still has the essentials features from Discord.

- Flotilla: an alternative to Discord focused on being independant,
  which means you can create an account (which will work on the entire
  NOSTR network) but you cannot create your own servers/guilds for free.
  You have to pay a service to host them or self-host them on a server
  you have.

- AdaptChat: an alternative to Discord with a very different (but still
  intuitive) interface that looks good. However, it still lacks some
  features although it got the basics right.

- Neremity: a direct alternative to Discord with most its features and
  actually somewhat forming communities. Actually very good. Also has
  some kind of Twitter-like social media inside of it.

- Common Ground: an alternative to Discord that also has a lot of UI changes
  and that is way more than just Discord. It's a whole social media on top
  of which is some kind of Discord-like chat features. Still, very good for
  communities and events. Also seems very stable.

- Quebic: an alternative to Discord that uses similar UI elements but 
  in different dispositions. For example, the server bar is at the top.
  Also, it seems more axed towards private communities/"spaces" than 
  actual public communities like Discord. Also lacks some more advanced 
  features.

- Echoed: a direct alternative to Discord clearly axed towards communities,
  has most features that Discord have including a mobile app. However,
  while the service remains entirelly free and without subscriptions,
  none of the components of the service are free software or have its source
  code released to the public. However, this wouldn't be a concern if 
  you come from Discord since Discord had the same problem.

- Mezon: a VERY direct alternative to Discord. The interface is literaly the same.
  Even if this is open-source, it seems suspiciously inclined to commercial purposes
  with AI integrations being highly advertised for example.

- Element, Element X, FluffyChat, Nheko, Fractal, Cinny, SchildiChat:
  Those are all different applications (clients) but they are all based on
  the same protocol and main instance called Matrix. Those are compatible
  between each other. They support guilds, reactions, voice and video channels,
  and most have mobile apps aswell. However, they have a very restrictive
  account system and login validation, and most of them are VERY slow on
  older devices due to heavy encryption. They also have a very different 
  interface than Discord. However, everything is open-source.

- Quiet Chat: Similarly to Element and Matrix clients, they are focused
  on security and strong encryption, which may make some old devices not
  work very well. Also they have absolutely no web version, you have
  to download their mobile or PC app to use the service or even register.

- 0xchat: alternative to Discord based on NOSTR. They have most essential
  features, but no way to use the app inside a webbrowser. You have to download
  a PC or mobile app to use the service.

- Hyalus: direct alternative to Discord, but development seems to have slowed
  down since start of 2024, and they miss a discovery tab to join communities.
  Also they just don't have any communities.

## What about other platforms?

For other apps, here are some popular alternatives:

- YouTube: PeerTube (fully independant from YouTube), Invidious (depends on
  YouTube for content), Odysee (very popular alternative to YouTube
  and fully independant), FreeTube (also depends on YouTube for content),
  DTube (fully independant, decentralized and uncensorable, built on Steemit
  and IPFS), Piped (dependant on content from YouTube), ReVanced (although
  illegal and dependant on YouTube, plus it's only available on Android),
  DiVine (yes, really, they're entirelly independant and built on NOSTR)

- Snapchat: There is none. Atleast none that has built-in filters.
  Building an open-source app with no funding that replaces Snapchat's complicated
  AR based filters is almost impossible.

- WhatsApp: Signal, Telegram, Wire, Tox, Briar, Bitchat, Delta Chat

- Instagram: Pixelfed, DiVine, Vernissage

- TikTok: Loops by PixelFed, DiVine, Olas

And for other platforms, you may find those websites useful:

- [AlternativeTo](https://alternativeto.net/) (it's prefered to use the "open-source" filter)

- [European Alternatives](https://european-alternatives.eu/)

- [OpenAlternative](https://openalternative.co/)

- [OpenSourceAlternative](https://opensourcealternative.to/)
